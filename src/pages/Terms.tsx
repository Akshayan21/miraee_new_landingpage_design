Examples of transactions that may not be monitored include balance transfers, payments of existing balances, transactions not processed or submitted through Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or another supported Payment Network, and other transactions outside Astrada’s or Miraee's product coverage. Not all cards are eligible for enrollment. Ineligible cards may include government-administered prepaid cards, EBT cards, healthcare cards (including HSA or FSA cards), insurance prepaid cards, consumer debit cards, consumer prepaid cards, cards not used primarily for business purposes, and any other card type that Miraee, Astrada, or the applicable Payment Network does not support.</p>

Upon deletion of a registered Payment Card, transaction monitoring for future transactions on that Payment Card will cease immediately for the applicable Miraee program. Deletion of a Payment Card does not require Miraee, Astrada, the applicable Customer, or the Payment Networks to delete or stop processing Transaction Data collected before deletion, which may be retained and processed in accordance with applicable law, these Terms, Miraee’s Privacy Policy, Astrada’s Privacy Policy, applicable Customer instructions, and legal, compliance, fraud-prevention, security, audit, and recordkeeping obligations.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>For Payment Cards enrolled through corporate-led or bulk enrollment, the Customer and any administrator submitting Payment Card information represent, warrant, and certify that they have provided all legally required notices and obtained prior written consent, as recognized under applicable law, from each employee, cardholder, or other authorized user whose Payment Card is enrolled. Miraee may request proof of such consent. Employees, cardholders, and authorized users acknowledge that their employer or Customer has obtained the required consent authorizing Payment Networks to access and share Transaction Data with Astrada, Miraee, and the applicable Customer to facilitate participation in the Platform and related spend management services.

Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice through <a href="/dispute-notice" style={{ color: T.orange, fontWeight: 600 }}>this form</a>. We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Arbitration forum. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable.  The activities described in these Terms involve interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and any arbitration.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Arbitration procedures. The location of the arbitration hearing will be in Austin, Texas unless the batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Texas. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of Austin, Texas have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Exceptions. This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and Miraee agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and Miraee knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Batch arbitration. If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file arbitration demands against Miraee within 90 days of each other and the claims raise substantially similar issues, you and Miraee agree that NAM will administer those arbitrations in batches of up to 50 claimants per batch.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Each batch will be treated as one consolidated arbitration. That means each batch will have one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing. The hearing will be held by videoconference unless the arbitrator decides that another location is appropriate. If there are fewer than 50 claimants in total, all claims will be administered as one batch. If more than 50 claimants are involved, NAM will create additional batches of up to 50 claimants each until all claims are assigned to a batch. If any part of this batching process is found to be invalid or unenforceable for a particular claimant or batch, that part will be severed, and the affected claim or claims will proceed in individual arbitration.</p>
                <p style={pStyle}>Severability. If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.</p>
