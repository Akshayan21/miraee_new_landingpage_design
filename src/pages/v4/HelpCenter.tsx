    ["How does Miraee handle policy?", "Policy is applied before search results are shown, so travelers only see options that are already compliant. Rules can be set by route, grade, trip type and entity, and out-of-policy requests are either flagged for review or blocked, depending on how you configure them."],
    ["Which systems does it integrate with?", "Identity providers via SSO and SCIM, HRIS platforms for traveler and cost centre data, ERP and accounting systems for expense posting, corporate card networks for payment, and calendar and messaging tools for itineraries."],
    ["How long is implementation?", "Pilots reach full deployment in as little as 90 days. Most programs start on one entity or region alongside their incumbent rather than switching everything at once."],
    ["Does it cover group travel and events?", "Yes. MICE, group booking, venue sourcing and attendee management run on the same platform and the same ledger as everyday business travel."],
    ["Is my data safe?", "Every agent action is logged and attributable, access follows role-based permissions, and the platform is built for SOC 2 operational controls, SSO/SCIM identity management and GDPR privacy by design."],
