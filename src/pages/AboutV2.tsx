const companySummary = "Miraee is an AI-native employee travel platform for corporate travel, expense management and personal trips. Built by Tabhi, an AI-first travel group of 23 companies, Miraee plans, books, changes and expenses business trips end to end using specialized AI agents running on one continuous context. The platform books flights, hotels, rail and car hire from live inventory covering more than 500 airlines and over two million properties, sourced through direct supplier connections and wholesale agreements held by the Tabhi group. Miraee serves three audiences: business travelers, finance teams and travel managers. Company policy is applied at the point of search rather than at approval, expenses are captured and coded automatically without traveler-submitted reports, and 24/7 human travel support is included. Miraee also supports employee personal travel on a separate ledger, using the same agent and corporate negotiated rates where supplier agreements permit. Tabhi's other platforms are Mondee, an agentic AI travel marketplace, and Abhee, a hyperlocal experiential marketplace. Tabhi ownership includes affiliates of TCW Asset Management Company and Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Miraee is available on web and mobile. Learn more at miraee.ai."

                            <p>Tabhi has been moving travelers for years — through a marketplace, through travel experts, through contracts held directly with airlines and hotels. Corporate travel was the one journey that never got simpler.</p>
                            <p>We didn't set out to build another booking tool. We had already seen what happens when you connect one to an expense tool and a support desk.</p>

                            <p>So we built the opposite: one agent, one thread, one continuous context, running on supply we already own. Miraee is what happens when the company that holds the contracts also writes the software.</p>
