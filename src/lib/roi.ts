// ROI / savings model for the Resources calculator. Pure functions and named
// constants, no React — so every number is auditable in one place and can be
// changed without touching the page.
//
// This is a marketing model aimed at finance buyers, so it is deliberately
// conservative in three ways that most such calculators are not:
//
//   1. The 20–30% band applies to FARES only (~75% of T&E), not to all spend.
//   2. Spend already inside a program earns only the incremental delta over an
//      existing negotiated discount, never the full band.
//   3. Spend brought under management is REPORTED BUT NOT ADDED to the total —
//      those dollars are already counted inside the fare-savings term, and
//      adding them again would inflate the headline by roughly 4–5% of annual
//      spend. See computeRoi().
//
// No subscription cost is netted out, because Miraee pricing is not public.
// The headline is therefore a gross figure and must be labelled as one.
