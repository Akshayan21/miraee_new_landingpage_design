// ─── Persona placeholder experience ───────────────────────────────────────────
// The content doc (Part 1.4) calls these "the single most important build on
// the site": each persona surface plays a scripted experience showing that role
// using Miraee, so no tab is ever empty before the real videos ship.
//
// This is the scripted-placeholder stage: a typed conversation driven from the
// demo and training scripts. When real footage lands, pass a `video` source and
// the same component plays that instead — no page changes needed.
//
// Accessibility: the animated thread is aria-hidden and a complete transcript is
// exposed to screen readers, so nothing depends on the animation running. With
// prefers-reduced-motion the whole script renders at once, no typing.
